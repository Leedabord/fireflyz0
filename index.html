  <!-- rewrite to be about ME -->

  <p><strong>Making websites is <em>still too hard</em>.</strong></p>

  <p>Bulding a static site is pretty easy--but learning how to let users log in, build and properly validate form input, and add search is a whole different ballgame. Many people just give up.</p>

  <p>Luckily, some new tools are making all this a lot easier. When combined, they make a pretty compelling package.</p>

  <p>That's what Firefly is--a couple of modern web tools put together to help you build real web apps. Think of it as a tiny alternative to Rails for people writing MVPs. Building something in Firefly is crazy fast--and when your project takes off, it's easy to extend with whatever else you need.</p>

  <!-- <p>You won't have to salt passwords, manage sessions, write login or password reset logic, monitor server uptime, build a REST api, or write SQL or joins</p> -->

  <p>I hope it helps you make something great!</p>

  <div class="callout">
    <h3>Warning</h3>
    <p>Firefly makes web development radically simple by not using backend servers, relational databases, unit tests, and other sane best-practices for enterprise codebases.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- <p>Ruby on Rails opened up web development to a whole generation of developers--even people who didn't think they WERE  developers before they found Rails. Without it, we wouldn't have many of the amazing services we have today. Properly framed, I think the modern JavaScript ecosystem can do the same.</p> -->

  <!-- <p>Firefly is intended to be an approachable starting place for writing "real" web apps. It's made especially for designers (and other people who are only used to writing a bit of client-side javascript but who don't have experience with servers and databases).</p> -->

  <h1 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h1>


  <h2 id="philosophy-modern">Cautiously Modern</h2>

  <p>Firefly takes advantage of some relatively new ideas in web development in order to make the code as  small as possible.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Modern Javascript</strong> - Firely uses modern Javascript and the huge JS ecosystem, with one major caveat: we don't go bleeding-edge. All libraries and services we use are well-established, used in production by major companies and will be supported for years to come.</li>
    <li><strong>Heavy front-end</strong> - Firefly uses the front-end as much as possible. This lets us have a single codebase for most of our app logic.</li>
    <li><strong>Serverless backend</strong> - What Firefly can't do on the client or with a 3rd party service, it does using Firebase Functions, which require no uptime monitoring or special deployment.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2 id="philosophy-simple">Radically Simple</h2>

  <p>Firefly's goal is NOT to be a toy for experienced engineers--it's to empower casual developers with other skills build working products as quickly as possible. That's why Firefly should not just be a great tool, but also a great teacher.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Less code</strong> - Lots of app boilerplates are daunting, but Firefly has as little code as possible--40 files at last count. The less code your app has, the less you have to understand and maintain.</li>
    <li><strong>Boilerplate</strong> - Firefly is just a demo app, not a library or framework. There are no scaffolds and no CLI. To add more models and views, just copy-and-paste the ones that are already there.</li>
    <li><strong>Extensible</strong> - Making it easy to add code means we don't have to include extra crap out-of-the-box. Firefly only has login, form validation, and search--everything else you <a href="#-next">add on your own</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Services</strong> - Instead of including code for complicated things like authentication and search, Firefly outsources all that to outside services. This increases the chances of <a href="">vendor lock-in</a>, but vastly reduces the amount of complex code for beginners.</li>
  </ul>


  <h1 id="how-it-works">How it works</h1>

  <p>Firefly is a single-page front-end web app boilerplate. Models have clear separation from Firefly views (Kind of like MVC, without the "C").</p>

  <p>If you're used to working with jQuery, Rails, or Express, Firefly is going to feel very different. There are a few concepts that are important to understand before you dive in.</p>

  <p>This not only makes it easier to, but easier to swap out smaller pieces of your app as new packages become available.</p>

  <p>The Post model and views are just as an example copy it to create more collections and views or rename it to reflect the main collection in your app.</p>

  <p>As you read, follow along with the <a href="">code on github</a>.</p>


  <h2 id="how-it-works-models">Models</h2>

  <h3>The database</h3>

  <p>Firefly uses the NoSQL <a href="">Firebase Real-time Database</a> for persisting data. Firebase is basically a big JSON file in the cloud that you can read/write to directly from a users web browser (no server required). Before you go much further, you should read the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/start">Firebase Real-time Database Guide</a>.</p>

  <p>Since Google Firebase is basically just JSON, it has no schema, no tables, and no collections. The convention in Firefly, however, is to use the top level of the database as a collection, the second level for unique keys for items in that collection, and the third level for the attributes of each item (like a row). For example:</p>

  <pre>{
  "dogs": {
    "1": {
      "name": "spot",
      "age": "4",
    },
    "2": {
      "name": "fido",
      ...
    },
    "3": {...},
  },
  "cats": {...}
}</pre>

  <h3>Firefly models</h3>

  <p>You shouldn't <em>have</em> to write to the database directly. Firefly makes it easy to add, read, and remove items with Javascript objects called models.</p>

  <p>Firefly models live in the <a href="https://github.com/sampl/firefly/tree/master/src/models">models folder</a>. You can write a Firefly model however you like, but the default models <a href="https://github.com/sampl/firefly/blob/master/src/models/Post.js#L4">extend</a> a <a href="https://github.com/sampl/firefly/blob/master/src/models/Supermodel.js">Supermodel class</a> that has a lot of helper functions for adding, querying, and deleting collection items.</p>

  <p>Most models simply modify and return the Firebase promise on the Firebase query library. This makes error handling in the views very simple. However it does require a bit of knowledge about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8IgdnYIwOU">how promises work</a>.</p>


  <h3>The User model</h3>

  <p>The User model is special--it has custom methods for signing in and out with Firebase auth.</p>

  <p>We use <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/start">Firebase Authentication</a> for logging users in, etc.</p>


  <h3>Relational data</h3>

  <p>Handling data that "relates" to other data is one of the most difficult parts of writing models. For example, how can you mark a post as "liked"--<em>and</em> see all the <em>posts</em> a user liked--without saving that data in two places?</p>

  <p>Firebase handles this much differently than most apps. Each collection can be directly manipulated by the clients. Each collection has some attributes that are only updated by Firebase server cloud functions.</p>

  <p>For example: when you like a post in Firefly, Firebase adds a new "like" to the <code>post_likes</code> collection. Then, a Firebase function adds 1 to the post's <code>_like_count</code> attribute so we can query and sort posts by the number of likes they have.</p>

  <p>Loop to query lots of results--fairly fast because Firebase batches db requests</p>

  <p><a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#add_firebase_to_your_app">Create a Service Account</a> to run maintenance scripts with <code>node scripts/test.js</code></p>

  <h3>Securing your data</h3>

  <p>Because clients can write data directly into your database, you need to write some security rules to keep bad guys from deleting data or viewing private data. <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/security">This video</a> does a great job explaining how these rules work.</p>


  <h2 id="how-it-works-views">Views</h2>


  <h3>Component-based views</h3>

  <p>Views in Firefly are built with <a href="">React</a>, which keeps a component's controller logic, templates, and even CSS all in a single file. If you're used to writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in different files, this will feel weird at first. Stick with it--writing your UI using all-on-one components will feel like a revelation soon. Start by reading the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html">official React guide</a>.</p>


  <h3>Routing</h3>

  <p>The router is the part of the app that shows different pages based on the URL. We use the popular <a href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides">React Router</a>.</p>


  <h3>Listening for updates</h3>

  <p>Many React apps use something like <a href="https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux">Redux</a> to for state management (which sort of a fancy way of saying "keep my views up-to-date when my data changes"). Many developers agree that <a>Redux is overkill</a> for a lot of simple apps.</p>

  <p>Instead, Firefly uses the much-simpler <a href="https://github.com/primus/eventemitter3">eventemitter3</a> library to let models announce when they've changed, and let views listen for those changes so they know to re-render.</p>


  <h2 id="how-it-works-other">Other stuff</h2>

  <p>Firefly uses <a href="">Create React App</a> and <a href="">Firebase command-line tools</a> to take care of transpiling, bundling, running tests, and deployment. You don't have to write or manage any configuration for this to work, just run <code>npm start</code> normally.</p>


  <h3>Bundling</h3>

  <p>Modern Javascript requires transpiling code to ensure that your app works on all browsers. Under-the-hood, Create React App uses Webpack to bundle all your files into a single <code>app.js</code>. It starts at <code>src/app.js</code>, finds all the files that it imports (and the ones they import, etc) and bundles them all up into a single <code>app.js</code>.</p>


  <h3>Hosting</h3>

  <p>We use Firebase hosting to host your app. Firebase hosting comes with HTTPS for free, and it's the same price as Google Cloud Platform object storage (very cheap). See <a href="#using-deploying">Getting Started: Deploying</a> for directions on deploying your app.</p>


  <h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>

  <div class="callout">
    <h3 id="getting-started-quick-start">Quick start</h2>

    <ol>
      <li><code>git clone https://github.com/sampl/firefly &amp;&amp; cd firefly &amp;&amp; npm install</code></li>
      <li><code>mv .firebaserc.example .firebaserc &amp;&amp; mv env.development.example env.development &amp;&amp; mv .env.production.example .env.production</code></li>
      <li>add your Firebase keys to <code>.firebaserc</code> and the <code>.env</code> files</li>
      <li><code>npm start</code></li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <h2 id="getting-started-prerequisites">Before you begin</h2>

  <p>This tutorial uses Git for version control. If you're not already a Git user, <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git">you can learn about it here</a>.</p>

  <p><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download">Download and install node</a> if you haven't already.</p>

  <p>Run <code>npm install -g firebase-tools</code> to install the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/">Firebase CLI</a>. You only need to do this once per computer.</p>

  <h2 id="getting-started-create">Creating your app</h2>

  <h3>Get the code</h3>

  <p>Firefly is just a boilerplate. To start a new Firefly project, we simply make a copy of Firefly.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>In your terminal, <code>cd</code> to the folder where you want your project to live.</li>
    <li>Clone this repo with <code>git clone https://github.com/sampl/firefly</code>.</li>
    <li>Go into the folder you just created with <code>cd firefly</code>. You can also rename the <code>firefly</code> folder to whatever you want.</li>
    <li>Run <code>npm install</code> to install all the packages Firefly needs.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>You've got your own Firefly app! Now let's tell it how to find the database.</p>

  <h3>Create the database</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Go to the <a href="console.firebase.google.com">Firebase console</a> and sign in with your Google account</li>
    <li>Create a new project and name it something like <code>MyProjectName (Stage)</code></li>
    <li>Click "Add Firebase to your web app"</li>
    <li>You'll see a block of code--leave this window open, you'll need it in a minute</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Connect to the database</h3>

  <p>Now let's connect our database to our app. The connection parameters are security secrets, so first we'll rename our environment files to keep them from getting committed into git (the new filenames are listed in <code>.gitignore</code>).</p>

  <ol>
    <li>First, rename <code>.firebaserc.example</code> to <code>.firebaserc</code> and replace the blank space next to "dev" with the <code>projectId</code> from the Firebase website.</li>
    <li>Rename <code>.env.development.example</code> to <code>.env.development</code>. Replace the blank spaces in that file with the codes from the Firebase website too.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Set up authentication</h3>

  <p>Before you can add any posts, you'll have to allow sign-in with Google. Firebase makes this very easy.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Back in the <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/">Firebase console</a>, click on "Authentication" in the sidebar on the left</li>
    <li>Click "Set up sign-in method"</li>
    <li>Click "Google", toggle the "Enable" switch, and hit "Save"</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="using-working">As you work</h2>

  <p>Start your app with <code>npm start</code>. You should see a basic web app in your browser! 😎</p>

  <p>Try logging in, then make sure you can create, like, edit, and delete posts.</p>

  <p>Now go back to your text editor and try editing some files. When you save, the changes should automatically appear in the browser.</p>

  <p>After each change, commit your work using <a href="">git</a>.</p>

  <p>When you're ready to deploy your app to stage, run <code>npm run stage</code>.</p>


  <h2 id="using-deploying">Deploying</h2>

  <p>Each project you make using Firefly actually uses <em>two</em> Firebase projects--one for development and staging, and one for the live production site. We already made the development project, now we need to make one for production.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Go back to <a href="#getting-started-firebase">Connecting to Firebase</a> and repeat the steps, but call this project something like <code>MyProjectName - LIVE</code></li>
    <li>Fill in the "production" value in <code>.firebaserc</code></li>
    <li>Rename <code>.env.production.example</code> to <code>.env.production</code> and add the new Firebase connection parameters there too.</p>
    <li><strong>Firefly is insecure by default. Before going live, <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/security">secure your app</a> by writing rules in <code>database.rules.json</code></strong></li>
  </ol>


  <p>When it's time to go live, run <code>npm run live</code>!</p>

  <p style="font-size: 2rem;">🎉 🎉 🎉</p>



  <h1 id="next">Next Steps</h1>

  <p>One of Firefly's principles is "as little code as possible", so you'll probably want to add some features to suit your app's needs.</p>

  <p>Create React App also includes <a href="">ESLint</a> to keep you from making small mistakes, the <a href="">Babel</a> transpiler to make sure the code you write works on all browsers, and <a href="">Jest</a> to run automated tests on your code.</p>
